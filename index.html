            <h2 class="greeting">Dear Ctrl+Alt Festival,</h2>
                <div class="letter-body">
                    <p>I am thrilled to have found this opportunity to build a website for the Ctrl+Alt Festival. This project excites me not only as a growing queer, nonbinary web developer and designer but also as a community organizer, anti-racism, equity and accessibility consultant, and communications professional who often works to support community arts organizations and programs.</p>
                    <p>With over eight years spearheading communications and project management in nonprofits, I have led with my passion for creating affirming community spaces and making resources and supports more accessible, understandable and engaging to the public. From developing and managing email marketing and social media strategies to leading impact assessment to advising on key messaging and content development to ensuring adherence to brand, style and accessibility guidelines, I have worn many hats and produced high-quality multimedia deliverables for a diversity of stakeholders and audiences.</p>
                    <p>Last year, I completed Senecaâ€™s Web Development and Design Certificate Program, deepening my project management, UX design, strategic communications, stakeholder engagement and quality assurance skills when building accessible, fully responsive websites, as you will see in <a href="#portfolio">my portfolio</a> below.</p>
                    <p>My lived experience, academic and professional background, and commitment to ongoing learning give me the expertise and drive to design the Ctrl+Alt Festival's new website.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I look forward to hearing from you and discussing this opportunity further.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,<br>Gowlene Selvavijayan</p>

                            <p>Artists Mentoring Youth is a Toronto-based performance arts mentorship and training program for gender diverse youth and women (ages 16-29). While troubleshooting and archiving their old website and its content, I led a mini rebrand and developed, restructured and supported the launch and maintainance of their new website. Throughout their site migration and relaunch, I implemented an SEO strategy and ensured brand recognition.</p>

Bringing a bolder, more modern look to their existing brand identity, I designed an accessible, fully responsive website and resource hub driving visitors to register for the initiative's upcoming summits.</p>

                            <p>Original Manna is a Black-owned all-natural local Canadian beauty skincare and wellness company. As Original Manna continues to grow, my client wanted to move away from Etsy
                            for sales. I developed a fully functional e-commerce site and spearheaded a rebrand with a brand new logo to support my client in strengthening their brand presence, integrating social media, having greater control over SEO and advertising, and expanding their reach further.</p>

                            <p>This is a student concept project with fictional branding. My cohort at Seneca's Web Development and Design program was assigned to develop a webpage exploring any colour of our choosing. I enjoyed using Bootstrap to dive into YInMn Blue and make this fully responsive website that adjusts and changes in different ways across various devices and screen sizes. Some fun features include a carousel and an accordion.</p>

                    <p><b>Gowlene Selvavijayan</b> (they/she) is a Tamil neuroqueer web designer, community organizer, digital communications specialist and storyteller. Born and raised in Scarborough, they moved to Ottawa in 2015 to study journalism and human rights at Carleton University. As a J-School graduate and communications professional of over eight years, they are no stranger to working with trauma-informed, cultural humility and a keen editorial eye while managing multiple overlapping priorities in high-pressure environments with quick turnarounds.</p>
                    <p>Gowlene is committed to the ongoing learning, practicing and embedding of anti-racism, equity and accessibility in web design and development, communications, community programming and internal policies and practices. In their work within academia, non-profits and the public service and as a freelancer, they have worked to strengthen the impact of research, academic scholarship, and community-based knowledge and make data, information and stories more accessible, compelling, practical, and understandable. Their work and strategic advice have supported organizations in fostering safety, community, knowledge sharing, and greater access to resources, especially for racialized, disabled, neurodivergent, queer, trans and gender diverse youth.</p>
                    <p>Gowlene takes pride in their curiosity, creativity, and ability to quickly learn new skills and technology to see a project to its utmost potential, foster empowered collaboration, streamline internal processes, and support organizational growth and transformation.</p>
